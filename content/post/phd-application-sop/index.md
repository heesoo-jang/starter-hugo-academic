## A summary of my PhD application journey <br>
I applied to Journalism and Media Studies/Communication science PhD programs in the US in 2018 for the 2019–2020 academic year. This is the Statement of Purpose (SOP) that got me final offers for five programs with fully funded packages and prestigious top-up offers—either for a stipend or separate research/travel funds—for more than half of the offers: University of Washington, University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Ohio State University, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I also was offered an on-campus interview to Northwestern University, although this didn’t lead to a final offer after determining this place wasn’t a good fit for me at the time. After two weeks of back-to-back campus visits, several gut checks, and deep conversations with people I trust, I decided to attend UNC-Chapel Hill. Some schools offered acceptance without interviews, while others went through multiple interview processes. Every program is different.

## My PhD Statement of Purpose (SOP) for PhD Applications 
#### Area: Media Studies/Communication Science
First things first, let me share my SOP since that’s what you’re here for. Priorities✨ This SOP was for the University of Washington; I don’t know where I misplaced my UNC one! I used the same template for all the programs I applied to, so this is the SOP I used for UNC as well. The paragraph I italicized was tailored for the different programs.

My primary research interest lies in the area of communication technology and society. I am especially interested in examining the use of algorithms in journalism, its social impact on users from both ends, and the ethical and legal questions concerning news quality, transparency, and accountability. Through my research, I aspire to contribute to forming a society in which everyone has equal access to quality news based on reliable information.<br>
<br>

As a young child, I had initially hoped to become a fiction writer. Writing novels, usually science fiction, in online writing communities, I had realized the importance of quality information and fact-checking. Although I was writing about the future, where androids and humans are indistinguishable, I felt that the readers wanted a believable narrative with authentic details. I would devote more time researching and checking facts to construct a realistically surreal background in which my story would unfold. For example, it took weeks of research before I could decide on what profession to give a character. If a character were to be a violinist, I would watch videos after videos of Itzhak Perlman’s performances, contemplating how to make my character the most believable.<br>

The lesson I had learned as a young writer on the importance of proper research and fact-checked information became more concrete during my internship at Joongang Ilbo, one of the major news outlets in South Korea. Working alongside veteran journalists, I was amazed to witness how much effort was put into checking and establishing factual grounds for an article. As an intern journalist, I was able to participate in that crucial role, undertaking numerous research to deliver reliable information to the public.<br>

I was also more than alarmed, however, to observe how the articles based on careful scrutiny of facts became sidelined amidst a deluge of articles carrying unreliable information. In today’s digital media environment, in which most newsreaders access and obtain information, provocative headlines and sensational images seemed to become increasingly pervasive. Following this observation, I became interested in examining how the digital environment influences and shapes journalism. More specifically, I found interest in studying how we could mitigate the negative aspects of the inevitable transformation of journalism.<br>

Such interest led me to enroll in the master’s program at Seoul National University’s Department of Communication, where I studied the theoretical framework and practical tools to formulate and pursue more substantial research questions. Under the supervision of Professor Sugmin Yoon, I researched how people access, appreciate, analyze, evaluate and share news in the digital environment where various algorithms are widely used to generate and distribute news articles.<br>

In particular, I took an interest in establishing a more comprehensive concept of news literacy based on existing theories to examine how news consumers behave in the digital environment. To construct a theoretically sound model of news literacy, I researched literature across various disciplines, including journalism, sociology, and information science. Such a multidisciplinary approach proved to be a difficult challenge as I attempted to analyze and incorporate different studies ranging from those on media effects to cognitive theories of information processing. However, I was able to develop a three dimensional model of news literacy based on individual knowledge structure, personal locus, and competencies and skills to conduct the research for my thesis.<br>

Utilizing the constructed model of news literacy, I undertook a quantitative study on how users from different generations perceive, understand, and use news differently in an environment increasingly influenced by algorithms and artificial intelligence. The statistical analysis of collected and operationalized data resulted in a novel finding. Contrary to the common belief that the younger generation is indifferent to the news, my study showed that they access news through various paths and platforms, evaluate them with different criteria, and generate more news-related communications through various sharing strategies. In other words, even compared to the older generation, the younger generation is anything but newsless, ignorant, or indifferent to the news. The significance of this finding was recognized by Seoul National University as it received a research grant from the Department of Social Science.<br>

Building upon such experiences, I have been working as a researcher and coordinator at the SNU FactCheck Center at Seoul National University. Currently, I am working closely with 28 major news outlets in Korea who contribute carefully verified fact-checked articles to the center’s web platform. Working at the core of fact checking in South Korea, I have had the opportunity to share and discuss the most up-to-date issues concerning the field. The most significant interest of the center and its partners lies in understanding how algorithms could be used to more effectively disperse fact-checked information than the currently pervasive pieces of disinformation and misinformation.<br>

At this juncture of my life, I am looking to broaden and deepen my understanding of the media through your Ph.D. program. More specifically, I aspire to address research areas involving the following themes and issues. First is the research on algorithms that generate personalized news articles. I want to contribute to this emerging field by automated systems identify data and news values, produce written contents and provide quality news articles.<br>

Moreover, I am interested in how these news algorithms influence the news using patterns of consumers. In the digital media environment, portal media companies such as Google and Facebook have started displaying algorithm-based news, changing how consumers access, understand, verify, and share news. By understanding changing news-using patterns, I will be able to provide implications to bring about more benefits for the consumers and society.<br>

Additionally, I wish to further develop this research by incorporating communication policy research. I expect to study how automated systems, including artificial intelligence, could affect the news industry. Through this research, I would like to examine the ethical and legal questions that cannot be overlooked. In the end, I wish to design public policy measures regarding the relationship between AI journalism and news literacy. I believe that news literacy is a crucial concept when it comes to concerns about news quality, transparency, and accountability regarding algorithms and automation. I believe that my master’s thesis on news literacy serves as a solid starting point for future research.
University of Washington provides an ideal environment for me to achieve my goal to explore the multifaceted questions on the role and mechanisms of news in the modern society. <br>

<i>Although I am delightfully open to a variety of research, there are several professors at University of Washington whose projects are especially appealing to me. In particular, I hope to work with Professor Lance Bennett as my research interests and area of expertise fit well with his research interests in how communication technologies including software generated news can enhance citizen engagement in the democratic society. I am also eager to study with Professor Richard Kielbowicz whose research problems focus on how technology and public policy affected the circulation of public information including news. I believe that his research provides me with a useful lens to examine the software generated news environment of today in a similar sense. Lastly, I am interested in Professor Katy Pearce’s research on understanding the affordances of information and communication technologies. I am interested in utilizing the concept of affordance in addressing the impacts of algorithms on users. I believe the expertise of these three professors will provide a rich context for my proposed research questions.</i><br>

Adaptability and flexibility are the two essential strengths that I have developed while living in Australia, Hong Kong, France, and South Korea, befriending people from various backgrounds. While pursuing three fields of studies, I have also developed multidisciplinary skills and knowledge from communication, business, and English literature. I believe that I have a lot to offer to the academic community of the University of Washington in terms of diversity both academically and culturally.

## Reflecting on my PhD SOP

I hadn’t initially planned to write a blog post about applying for PhD programs because my experience was pre-pandemic, and I feel like many things have changed since then. However, I’ve received numerous requests for advice on PhD applications—sometimes due to overlapping research interests or methodologies, or because you’re applying to institutions I’ve been a part of. So, I decided to share the statement of purpose (SOP) I wrote when I applied for US PhD programs. I hope this helps many, as my job market materials have, especially for those without access to the tangible and intangible resources needed to navigate higher education.
<br>

I can’t say this is the only way to write an SOP—consider it just one example of how someone else has approached it. How you express yourself in these statements, how much you want to share, and what you want to focus on will differ based on your personality, goals, and what works best for you. For example, SOPs for PhD programs in the natural and engineering sciences will look different from my social science SOP. Additionally, whether the search is designed for the SOP to be written solely for the principal investigator of your potential lab or for the full search committee is also a factor to consider in how you design your SOP. 

Looking back, I feel grateful and proud of my earlier self. Writing any type of personal statement—whether for a PhD program or an academic job—has given me invaluable opportunities to pause, reflect on the bigger picture, and check in with myself before moving forward to the next chapter of my career. 

Revisiting my SOP while on the academic job market for tenure-track positions allowed me to see how much I’ve grown and what has remained consistent. The research program and interests I outlined in my PhD SOP are still highly relevant, and I fully intend to continue pursuing these lines of study beyond my PhD. 

That said, some of my recent research projects, like those on online harms, emerged after I began my program, through connections with scholars and issues that resonated deeply with me—such as digital sex trafficking in South Korea. My undergraduate and master's programs did not teach Public Relations, so I started PR research after I entered my PhD program as well. So, don’t be afraid if your journey takes you in a different direction than you initially outlined in your SOP; it’s part of the process of growth and discovery.

### For Those Breaking Barriers
To those of you who are first-generation students, people of color, individuals with disabilities, international students, and anyone leaving their family behind for post-graduate education—truly, anyone who identifies with any marginalized identity—you’re navigating a uniquely challenging journey, and I want to commend you for your courage and determination. It’s important to recognize that your experience may be very different from those who don’t share your background, and that difference is not a weakness; it’s a source of strength.<br>

Please don’t be too hard on yourself if everything isn’t perfectly in place. The landscape of higher education can feel like a complex maze, filled with obstacles that others may not have to face. Acknowledge your efforts and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Remember, your journey is valid, and it’s okay to seek support and take your time as you carve your own path. You are not alone in this, and your resilience is a powerful testament to your strength and commitment. Your unique perspective is invaluable, and it will enrich the academic community and beyond. Keep pushing forward—you’ve got this!<br>

## Miscellaneous Advice
This is a collection of miscellaneous advice that I’ve shared with people I deeply care about and want to see succeed in graduate school. I hope this helps you too!<br>

### Talk with Current Students in the Program

Engaging with current students can provide invaluable insights into the program’s culture, faculty interactions, and overall experience. They can share their personal journeys, challenges, and successes, giving you a clearer picture of what to expect. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about coursework, research opportunities, department culture, and, more importantly, support systems, power dynamics, and the cost of living. There is so much information that may not be available on the website and can only be gathered through personal conversations. Don’t be surprised if you hear that they were advised not to share anything beyond what’s in the official handbook. Even if they don’t answer these questions, it’s still worth noticing which departments or programs are confident and open enough to allow their graduate students to share freely about their experiences—and which are not.<br>

### Remember, You’re Also Interviewing the Faculty and the Program

The application process is a two-way street. While the program is assessing your fit, it’s equally important for you to evaluate whether the faculty and program align with your research interests and values. Look beyond the formal aspects of the program and pay attention to the faculty's approachability, responsiveness, and how they interact with students. Engaging with potential advisors during interviews or campus visits can provide valuable insights into their mentoring style and availability. In addition, consider the program's culture and how it supports student development. A supportive environment fosters collaboration, innovation, and a sense of belonging. Being a PhD student is already a lonely process; there is no need to choose a program that adds to that loneliness. Don’t underestimate the power of a supportive environment.<br>

### Location and Weather Are More Important Than You Think

The location of your program can significantly impact your experience, shaping not only your academic life but also your personal well-being. Consider the community, lifestyle, and resources available in the area. A supportive and vibrant community can enhance your overall experience, providing networking opportunities, social connections, and access to local events and activities that enrich your PhD journey. Additionally, the weather can greatly affect your daily life and mental well-being. If you thrive in sunny climates, a program in a colder region might not be the best fit for you. Consider factors such as cost of living, availability of recreational activities, and the proximity to family and friends. Don’t underestimate the power of a supportive environment and a climate that suits you.<br>

### Think About Your Goals for the PhD Program

Before applying, clarify your goals for pursuing a PhD and what you hope to achieve during and after your studies. Your objectives may evolve as you progress, which is perfectly okay. Different programs prepare you for various career paths, so ensure the programs you consider align with your long-term aspirations, whether in academia, industry, or beyond. If you’re like me, you might want flexibility in coursework to explore interdisciplinary interests, test out industry roles, or engage in community-based work. Reflect on the type of mentorship and academic environment that will best support your growth, and remember that each experience along the way contributes to your unique journey. Embrace the process with an open mind, as unexpected turns can lead to valuable opportunities.
