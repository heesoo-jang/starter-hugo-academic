## Thinking about taking Journalism & Law (JOURNAL 445)? 


Hi! If you’re here, you’re probably one of our students at UMass Amherst thinking about taking Journalism and Law (JOURNAL 445) with me. 

First off: welcome, brave soul. 

Second: yes, I’m still pretty new around here — as of Fall 2025, this is only my third semester teaching at UMass. And no, I don’t have a RateMyProfessor page for my teaching at UMass Amherst yet (so you’re basically writing history by being in my class ✨).  

I’m so glad you’re interested in taking this class. 

Journalism and law are deeply intertwined: the First Amendment shapes how journalists do their work, and journalists play a key role in holding the law (and lawmakers) accountable. Understanding this relationship isn’t just useful if you want to be a reporter — it’s also about knowing your rights as a citizen in a democracy. In short: this stuff *matters*.  

I get it — taking a law class with a professor you don’t know sounds *super* scary. And you know what? Past students agree with you! 

But here’s the twist: they survived, they thrived, and many of them even enjoyed themselves (yes, really, even with the legal jargon).  

At the end of every semester, I ask my students to write a **“letter to future students.”** 
Think of them as your survival guide, pep talk, and inside scoop all rolled into one. They’re unedited, honest reflections — what students wish they’d known, what they struggled with, and what they loved.  

So if you’re wondering what this class is *really* like, keep reading. These voices belong to students who’ve been right where you are now. I hope their words give you some clarity, maybe even a laugh, and definitely a little encouragement.  

And who knows? At the end of the semester, *you* might be the one writing the next letter to future students — carrying on the tradition of saving the next wave of nervous, curious, future journalism and law folks. (No pressure. Okay, maybe just a little pressure. But the good kind!)  

Each semester looks a little different depending on class size and groupings, but the big picture and what you’ll take away from this course always remain the same.

Now, here’s the wisdom to carry with you—straight from students who were in your seat not long ago. 

Still got questions? I've got you. Email me at heesoojang@umass.edu

## Emily Johnson (Spring 25)
> Dear future Journalism and Law student,
>
> This class will be one of the most important, in terms of content, that will apply to the rest of your lives and careers. Especially in the current political climate we live in, knowing your rights as a journalist as well as just a citizen is so important… Through all of the ups and downs of your semester keep in mind that your education, before all else, is about your learning– not just the grades.  
> It’s so easy to get caught up and feel like finishing and submitting assignments is the most important thing but appreciate the process of learning new things because after college that experience isn’t as common for most.
> Also Heesoo is amazing and truly cares about her students, you are so lucky to have the opportunity to take this class so take full advantage of it!
>
> Sincerely, 
>
> a past Journalism and Law student :)

## Aivree Kus (Spring 25)
> Dear reader,
>
> If you feel like you’re in a trap, trust me, you aren’t in one. While you may be looking at the syllabus thinking ‘how am I going to complete this course?' just take a breath and relax, it’s a lot of information, but it makes your life easier in the long run. The semester brings everyone together, and by the time you're done, you won’t want to leave. Expect an easy way to ask questions without having to raise your hand, thanks to sticky thoughts, which double as a way for you to show you are in class for the day. The FIRACS, sit down and read. Take your time and read it as many times as you need. These really give you an opportunity to fully understand what the class is about and the material you are seeing in class. I think the one legal case that is vital to keep with you is the New York Times v. Sullivan case, which you might cover for your first FIRAC. It helps determine malice and when it can be used legally. You’ll learn how far the Supreme Court will go to uphold the 1st amendment. It’ll be eye opening, and you might take this new knowledge into your own life more than you realize, especially with how you might view politics. Make sure to project your voice during your presentations, bring note cards, and find quotes to say, this will allow you to have solid facts to support your ideas. Just know everyone is just as anxious, and those viewing are more concerned about their feedback forms, which are more content based anyway. A challenge I had in this class was presenting, so trust me if I could nail it while being anxious, so can you. I had this magical moment where as soon as I presented in front of Heesoo, I did unbelievably good and then went back to being anxious in front of everyone. I would recommend taking notes during class and trying to keep a focus on this to help you with your sticky thoughts for the day. It also reinforces what information you learned. Well, dear reader, get out your map and get ready to run this class. Have faith in yourself, it’s not as scary as it may seem!

## Maggie (Spring 25)
> This class is actually so fun. I’m not joking when I say that Heesoo is one of the best professors ever. What you can expect from this class is a lot of learning, as well as a large amount of participation.  
>   
> Do not be nervous about presentations, it is really not that serious. I do get nervous with presentations but Heesoo makes such a comfortable environment that it does not feel scary.  
>   
> You will learn the legal jargon, Heesoo makes it so easy to understand.

## Ty Priest-Heck (Spring 25)
> This semester was so much fun; I made many friends and learned a lot. You should expect to show up to most of the classes prepared to learn. There are heavy concepts throughout the course, but Heesoo makes a point of offering extra support and going through each concept thoroughly.  
>   
> I think one legal concept that I will take with me is defamation. You often hear about defamation in the media… but I didn’t know what it meant or, more importantly, how I could be sued for it.  
>   
> This class will entirely change the way you think about law… Journalists interact with the law significantly more than you would think.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Follow the exact outline of Heesoo’s practice presentation, and you will be just fine. She’s a very reasonable grader as well. Also, you do it in a group of 3 or 4, so odds are you won’t have to do all the work.  
>   
> Honestly, I’m most proud of the community that this class built together. We all laughed, had difficult conversations, and asked big questions. Overall, I’m incredibly grateful I got to take this class.

## Samantha Craddock (Spring 25)
> This semester was good! It was significantly less busy and stressful than my fall semester.  
>   
> **What should I expect?** A lot of discussion, a super chill and comforting environment, and a loooooot to learn.  
>   
> **One takeaway concept?** Defamation. It makes so much sense but there are so many fine lines and weird loopholes in it.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** I have actively began applying ideas and cases and laws and whatever to a lot of aspects of my daily life, especially in this political climate.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Read the case on Oyez. It is the most digestible way to understand legal cases and opinions. Also, you’re going to be presenting with other people so you won’t be alone!  
>   
> **Legal terms?** It definitely was a challenge for me, but I would just write down important words and definitions to reference back to on a piece of paper.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Read the slides. Read the chapters. Read and digest the cases. Read read read read.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I’m proud of my Case Studies because I was nervous about not understanding the cases or not getting the facts right!

## Rylee Davis (Spring 25)
> This semester was really fun! I learned a lot of new things, but it all felt very attainable.  
>   
> **What to expect?** There will be a lot of group discussion and opportunities for participation. Expect to learn a lot in class, and be prepared to ask questions.  
>   
> **Key case?** NYT v. Sullivan… It strengthened the rights of journalists by outlining a higher standard for libel claims against public officials.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** There are so many caveats to what you can and can’t do. Having an understanding of journalism-specific rights in addition to public and private citizen rights means you can protect yourself.  
>   
> **Presentations?** They are a little daunting at first, but very helpful… Your classmates will be supporting you to succeed! As long as you have the visuals and understand the content, you will be ok! Practice is key!  
>   
> **Legal terms?** Sometimes it can get a little confusing, but we do review days which can help clear it up.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** You will succeed if you pay attention and do the assignments!  
>   
> **Proud moment?** When I made the poster with the FIRAC method and presented it a couple of times, I could feel myself understanding it more and more.

## Mehrob Fatemi (Spring 25)
> On Day 1, I was petrified. I’d heard from past students that this class was incredibly long, time-consuming, deadline loaded and concrete; and packed with work. I was even more afraid when Professor Jang handed out 14 page syllabus packets… However, as I read through it, I still saw understanding and leniency.  
>   
> The biggest thing I noticed from the first to second half of the semester, was the discussions we got into. The discussions were always welcomed during class, but especially in the second half of the semester, I found Professor Jang promoting in depth conversations…  
>   
> Over the last two months I did not go to many classes… but I found myself learning on my own through lecture notes and the content published in weekly modules. Everything was clear and concise to understand on my own, and it worked incredibly well when working on my Midterm and Final Papers.  
>   
> …Make sure to communicate [your outside commitments] early on, and then keep up with the class online as best you can, because it will leave you behind if you’re not careful. It is not a lot of work, but it takes discipline, dedication, and grit. Take it one step at a time is my word of advice.  
>   
> Thank you for a phenomenal semester. I recommend this class to any journalism student… if you’re looking for a way to get out of your comfort zone and improve your presentation skills, this is the class for you.

## Beckett Storey (Spring 25)
> I learned so much from Heesoo and the rest of the class this semester. I became a better journalist and a more informed member of society.  
>   
> **What to expect?** This class will challenge you to research and learn more about our system of government. It is crucial to pay attention and keep up with the learning, but if you do, you’ll have no issues succeeding.  
>   
> **Key concept?** Libel and defamation… we spent ample amounts of time preparing and learning about the concept.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** It will make you realize that we are much more vulnerable than many may expect in the current landscape.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Presenting will always be a little scary. It’s so important to prepare ahead of time and get together with your group and practice.  
>   
> **Legal terms?** Not really, Heesoo is excellent at making big topics easily digestible.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Study, research outside of class, and pay attention to slides.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I’m very proud of my presentations throughout the semester. Enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of legal cases.

## Anonymous Student 1 (Spring 25)
> Dear Future Student,  
> This is probably one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. It is information heavy but the professor is very informative and listens to the students’ needs. Speak up for yourself and participate a lot. You get what you give and if you’re actively trying you will definitely succeed.  
>   
> You will for sure learn a lot of legal concepts and doctrines and have new insight as to why certain companies get away with things and average people don’t. It’s a learning experience and a great one at that. You’ll do great 🫶🏽

## Anonymous Student 2 (Spring 25)
> The semester was good overall… definitely a lot of pressure coming from all of my classes but I made it!  
>   
> **Expectations?** Presenting and talking and being comfortable with your classmates is one of the top things you will be doing.  
>   
> **Key case?** Tinker v. Des Moines… it taught me my freedom of expression and rights as a student at a public institution.  
>   
> **Advice?** Start working on them a week before… practice public speaking out loud.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Manage your time wisely and don’t wait until the day before.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** Building more confidence in my public speaking skills.

## Anonymous Student 3 (Spring 25)
> My experience this past semester in Journalism and Law has been amazing! It was relatively stress-free while still learning a good amount.  
>   
> If you’re not a big reader you might have some trouble, mainly because there is a good amount of legal reading involved, especially during case presentations. They aren’t anything to stress about… just make sure you review your notes.  
>   
> **Key takeaway?** Free speech isn’t always free. This class breaks that down and shows how speech is governed selectively.  
>   
> **Managing jargon?** Simplify it into elementary terms.  
>   
> **Advice?** Be present. Be proud of every little accomplishment because most assignments take a lot of time.  
>   
> I wish you the best of luck!

## Anonymous Student 4 (Spring 25)

> Overall this semester has been one of the most interesting ones to date. Loads of new responsibilities and struggles… but we made it through!  
>   
> **Expectations?** Loads of concepts and ideas, fun times, and great conversation. Also a few presentations here and there.  
>   
> **Key takeaway?** One legal concept you’ll become familiar with is definitely the First Amendment.  
>   
> **Advice for presentations?** Use the resources available to you… Everyone is in the same boat as you, DON’T FORGET THAT.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Go back and look at slides if you have any lingering questions. Canvas is your friend.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** My presentation is something I’m proud of. You put so much time and effort into understanding the case and then creating the presentation that becomes something you’re proud of in the end.

## Anonymous Student 5 (Spring 25)
> I had a bunch of personal stuff going on this semester, but coming to this class was like a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed the content and generally looked forward to coming to class each week.  
>   
> **Expectations?** Expect to read legal opinions and expect to question how some people managed to get as far in life as they did (I’m looking at you NYT v. Sullivan).  
>   
> **Key concept?** Libel v. slander and defamation in general… important for journalists to keep in mind.  
>   
> **Presentations?** An absolute breeze! Professor Jang gives you a demo to ease your nerves and is calm and kind during your actual presentation.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Engage in class and ask questions… Don’t try to do everything on your own.  
>   
> Overall, this class will make you more aware of your rights as a journalist and how the law and media intersect

---

## Anonymous Student 6 (Spring 25)
> This class has a very good community. A lot of great in-class discussions take place here, leading you to get to know your peers very well. Heesoo is a great professor and she works very hard to create detailed PowerPoint presentations every week. She’s also very supportive and understanding, and she’s here to help. I will say that I had never taken a law class before and had no legal knowledge before this class, so I did struggle a little. To learn from my mistakes, please take advantage of office hours and do ask for help if need be.

## Andre Ayuyao (Fall 24)
> The semester has been great. I've been really busy but productive at the same time. I'm excited to wrap it up and head into the Christmas break.  
>   
> **What to expect?** This class is content-heavy, there are a lot of concepts and cases you need to learn about and cover. With that being said, the way Professor Jang approaches this information makes it very accessible. Expect to put in some time when making presentations or doing research for assignments.  
>   
> **Key case?** NYT v. Sullivan (1964); It’s important because it sets the actual malice standard in law. It’s one of the first things you learn when discussing libel and slander. Understanding NYT v. Sullivan’s holding is foundational to learning about media law.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** This class equipped me with the tools and knowledge necessary to understand the legality of media. As a journalist, this is useful to avoid illegality and as a (maybe) future lawyer it introduced me to media law. It was especially profound because I learned how to read court opinions and other legalese.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Worst comes to worst, you could always ask Professor Jang for some help. If you're nervous, my advice would be to over-prepare to the point that there is no room for nervousness.  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** Reflection papers are not difficult. It is the same as any essay they assign you here at UMass. It is hard if you don't do your due diligence and easy if you do.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Pay attention in class, read the textbook if needed, do the assignments, and always do background research.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I’m proud of my presentations, they were my favorite activity in this class. My second presentation could have gone better and I wish I was able to present my final presentation in class. However, my first presentation went remarkably well.

## Hannah Berry (Fall 24)
> In all honesty, this semester was brutal for me. I graduate in a week and I have been overwhelmed all semester… However, I absolutely loved this class! This was a class I enjoyed coming to every Monday/Wednesday because of the community in the class.  
>   
> **What to expect?** You should expect to complete three presentations throughout the semester (they really help you grasp the information in a deeper way), engage with your classmates each class and get to know them as people outside of being students, and complete feedback on other student's work. You will learn a lot throughout this course through discussion and deep engagement with the content. I wish I could take another semester of this class.  
>   
> **Key concept?** You definitely need to know your First Amendment rights. A majority of court cases and legal issues often refer back to your First Amendment rights.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** This class has granted me further knowledge of my own rights as a human being and as a journalist. It made me realize that there is such a large scope of law regarding so many different and even tiny topics… You will think more critically about how law works in the media world.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Don’t worry about the presentations—I was really nervous too! Professor Jang is there for you and wants to help you succeed. The presentations are really helpful in having you engage deeper with the material—enough so that you can teach the class yourself!  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** I am a journalism major and an aspiring writer, so I enjoyed writing the midterm and reflection final papers. My challenge was trying to keep my writing concise and under 600 words.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** You will succeed in this class! Make sure to do the extra credit Professor Jang offers—it can really help your grade. Stay in good touch with her and keep her in the loop. Attend every class session so that you can complete the response papers in class and be involved in the group discussions.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I am proud of completing this class and hopefully receiving an A during my hardest semester of college. I am proud of how much I learned!

## Grace Chai (Fall 24)
> It was difficult emotionally at times but academically I think I did really well!  
>   
> **What to expect?** This class will make you think. You will be confused at times because there is a lot of information and legal jargon to process, but you'll learn valuable things so take it all in with an open mind.  
>   
> **Key concept?** Probably what the definition of libel is, because people confuse it with slander all the time. Libel is written, false information, harms the reputation of another, and has to be seen by at least one other person. Knowing your rights as a journalist is very important, because if someone is suing you but the information is true, you cannot be sued for libel.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** You'll learn that media law is constantly changing because technology is rapidly changing, and that a lot of it is based on prior cases.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Don't be nervous! Your classmates are also going through the same thing and have similar worries, and you're all there to grow alongside each other. Do your research, write your speaker notes ahead of time, anticipate questions, and have your water bottle next to you when you present so you stay hydrated.  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** The reflection papers simply take time to write, but they're not that bad. Try to go into it with the mindset that you will try your best, but that nothing has to be perfect.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Give yourself plenty of time to do research and work on slides for presentations. Go to office hours, like actually—they're helpful and you can save yourself a lot of stress by simply asking what is required of you in your coursework.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I'm happy to say I can do hard things and be resilient through a very busy and demanding semester.

## Eva Maniatty (Fall 24)
> This semester was full of growth and was character building.  
>   
> **What to expect?** Expect to be an active participant in discussions and to read!  
>   
> **Key concept?** I know how to interpret the First Amendment. It’s important because a lot of people think it’s complete freedom of speech.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** I have a better understanding of how to defend myself as a journalist and can be prepared.  
>   
> **Presentations?** I would read and highlight different parts of the textbook for the chapter you’re using. Then use the syllabus to incorporate the grading criteria needed in the presentation. Use the example presentation as a guide!!  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** The most challenging part was coming up with a topic. It took me about 2–3 hours for the midterm.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Ask questions, don’t be hesitant about participating. Communicate with the professor if you are lost, and don’t wait until the last minute to start assignments.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I’m proud of my final presentation. I was able to answer all the questions my classmates had and completely understand the case.

## Crissy Saucier (Fall 24)
> This semester has been kind of difficult for me to juggle my course load across the five classes I am taking. However, I am glad the semester is coming to an end.  
>   
> **What to expect?** Journalism and Law is a great class based on participation and peer engagement that has given me the foundational knowledge of media law, specifically concerning journalism. Each student in the class completed 3 presentations and wrote 2 papers to articulate their learned knowledge in the class.  
>   
> **Key case?** I think the New York Times vs. Sullivan case is an extremely important case to consider, as it outlines the idea of libel, which is recurring in the topic of media law in journalism. As a journalism major, I think it is critical to be familiar with the legal principles that have guided the development of journalism to become what it is today.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** For me, the class has given me a better understanding of how law works in the media world, specifically in the press. It has taught me to be more critical when considering what to include in my articles and research as well as to be more generally conscious of how larger media outlets operate today.  
>   
> **Presentations?** Before each presentation, I would read and take notes on my assigned chapter/case, then structure my presentation to follow previous presentations—highlighting the background, procedural history, issue/rule of law, conclusion, and impact of the case. For each presentation, I would send Heesoo a copy of my presentation requesting feedback. It’s totally valid to be nervous about presenting, but after your first presentation, I guarantee your nervousness for future presentations in the course will ease up.  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** The most challenging part of writing reflection papers for me was just getting started with them. Once I got in the flow of each paper, I was able to stick with them and complete them.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** I definitely recommend checking in with Heesoo Jang either through email or office hours throughout the semester. She is extremely helpful and an understanding professor who has really helped me through the course between questions about my presentations and reflection papers.  
>   
> **Proud moment?** Something I am especially proud of accomplishing in this class is improving my public speaking skills. Even though they are not nearly perfect, I am still definitely more confident and comfortable speaking in front of my peers.

## Anonymous Student 7 (Fall 24)
> It was filled with ups and downs, but my classes went really well. I enjoyed them, overall.  
>   
> **What to expect?** You should expect to actively participate in group discussions about legal cases and concepts. Definitely come to class prepared!  
>   
> **Key concept?** The First Amendment, for sure. It ties back to almost everything we learned about. Even cases you don’t expect to have it be relevant to remain relevant.  
>   
> **How will this change your thinking?** Cases you never thought about and laws you never thought about come up a lot, making this a very insightful course about the way the legal system works.  
>   
> **Presentations?** I prepared by practicing in front of my friends and family. Also, definitely bring a water bottle up with you! Speaking for so long can be tedious.  
>   
> **Reflection papers?** As long as you go to class and listen/participate in discussions, I found them to be fairly self-explanatory. That said, I totally get your worry. I would say treat the papers like they’re part of the in-class discussion you have with your classmates and write down what you’d say.  
>   
> **Tips for success?** Go to class, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to ask for support from the instructor!  
>   
> **Proud moment?** I’m proud that I got through all three presentations without being too anxious!
