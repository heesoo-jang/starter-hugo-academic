## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I was on the job market in the academic year of 2023-2024, applying for assistant professor jobs in departments of journalism, communication, and media studies. I will be an assistant professor in media law and ethics in the Department of Journalism, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, starting September 1. 

I'm writing this blog post with the hope of shedding some light on what to expect from the academic job market, sharing some thoughts and strategies I found helpful. Especially for those without a recent graduate to turn to for advice, I want to share my experiences. This is for anyone feeling a bit lost or unprepared about navigating the academic job journeyâ€”a friendly guide from someone who's been there. You're not alone ðŸ’™

<br>

## Summary of my journey
I knew I would be on the job market for 2023-24 by May, so I started promoting myself being on the job market starting at the AEJMC job hub in August. I applied to around 25 schools for an assistant professor position (including open rank searches) in my field (mostly in journalism and strategic communication), and another 10 in computer science and public policy, targeting AI ethics and social science roles despite being less familiar with their culture. After applying to  R1s and research-focused R2s known for their strong communities, I received 7 Zoom interview requests (all from journalism and strategic communication, none from other fields), progressed to campus visits with three schools, and received two official offers. Ultimately, I accepted the offer from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

## The academic job market calendar
Here's how my academic year looked like while being on the job market. I wanted a job that I could start in the academic year of 2024-25. 

<ul>
  <li><b>Mayâ€”August 2023: Ask for job materials and start drafting yours </b> 

  ðŸ‘‰ Action items: <br>
    1. Ask for job materials and start your first drafts <br>
    2. Promote that you're on the job market this year
  
  <br>

  Knowing I would be on the job market, I asked mentors and recent successful graduates to share their job materials with me. These materials provided excellent examples that helped me understand how to organize my CV, the meaning of research and teaching statements, how they differ from a cover letter, and what to emphasize in them.

<br>

  Also, I discussed the job market extensively with my advisor and held meetings specifically for this purpose. Additionally, I had several coffee chats with other mentors in the field over Zoom and at conferences for advice. 
  
<br>

  I was fortunate to have such supportive mentors and an advisor, but if you don't, I encourage reaching out to people in your field online as early as possible. The hidden curriculum in academia is vast, and finding support early is crucial. 
  
<br>

  Especially if you're a woman or nonbinary, identify as queer, are not a US citizen, are first-generation, or a person of color, I encourage you to find a mentor who has navigated the job market from your position. Just because we're on the same job market, it doesn't mean we're navigating the job market in the same way.</li>

  <li><b>September 2023: Get those job ads while finalizing your job materials</b> 
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Action items: <br>
    1. Make spreadsheet to organize job ads <br>
    2. Finalize job materials and get multiple rounds of feedback
  
  <br>
  
  This is when a lot of job ads start rolling out. Do everything to catch those job ads! It's easy to miss them because there's no single place where they're all collected. Sign up for major conference listservs in your field. For me, that was ICA, NCA, AEJMC, and AoIR. I also checked the communication job wiki for new job ads. Being part of the <a href="https://citap.unc.edu/">Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at UNC</a>, I received several job ads through our Slack as well (FYI: CITAP calls for graduate affiliates annually, and you don't need to be at UNC). The networking and promoting I did over the summer paid off, as graduate students and faculty sent me job ads directly to me when their institutions were hiring an assistant professor in my field. Faculty at my current institution also let people know I was on the job market, which was incredibly helpful.
  
  <br>

  While collecting these job ads, I started building a spreadsheet with the school name, the position, due date, and the job materials they require. This spreadsheet was useful for two purposes. First, my future self thanked me. With so many job ads rolling out, I couldn't have been able to track all of them without a spreadsheet. Second and more importantly, I shared the spreadsheet with my advisor to strategize where to apply and also keep her up-to-date with the deadlines for job materials and reference letters (if it required one at the application stage.) 

<br>

  September was also the month I tried to get multiple feedback from my advisor and other mentors on my job materials. </li>
  
  <li><b>October 2023: Applying for jobs and starting zoom interviews</b></li>
  ðŸ‘‰ Action items: <br>
    1. Apply for jobs every single day... ugh <br>
    2. Start getting zoom interviews <br>
  
<br>
  
  Applying for academic jobs felt like a full-time job in itself (without the pay for your labor). In October, I was applying to jobs every. single. day. No research got done, but I had a supportive advisor and mentors who assured me this was normal and okay. Don't be too hard on yourself while applying for jobs because there's already a lot of writing, sending emails, and bureaucratic tasks involved.

  I started getting Zoom interviews in mid-October. I remember asking mentors what to expect from Zoom interviews. For me, they were really helpful for understanding what the institution was looking for in this hire. Most search committees asked what they're interested in first, and I took note of that. The follow-up questions gave me insight into what the faculty prioritized in this hire. I also looked for cues like whether the interview was one-way or two-way, whether they cared about work-life balance (because I do), and if we agreed on what constitutes meaningful research.

### November 2023: Fly-outs and job talks
<b>  ðŸ‘‰ Action items: <br>
    1. Draft your job talk slides and do prep talks <br>
    2. Fly-outs! Lookout <br>
 </b> 
<br>
  
  I was invited for my first on-campus visit in early November, with two more spread out over the month. I began drafting job talk slides, and my advisor scheduled a prep talk for me, inviting several faculty members and graduate students.

  I was SO grateful that my advisor went ahead and scheduled these prep talks for me. I needed the practice for sure. Job talks were so long for a first timer like me. It felt so strange to be allotted almost an hour to discuss my research. Typically, at conferences, I've been given only four minutes on average, and at most seven minutes if I'm fortunate to receive the best paper award.

  I am incredibly grateful to everyone who attended my prep talks to provide feedback and boost my confidence. After conducting two prep talks and receiving feedback, I improved significantly. With immense respect for UNC's faculty and graduate colleagues, I knew that if they believed I was ready, others would too.

  The fly-outs provided fantastic opportunities to immerse myself in the campus and academic communities of potential institutions. The schedule included one-on-one or group meetings with faculty members, meetings with students, and a job talk (with teaching demonstrations at two of the schools, but not the third). I especially appreciated having separate time with the students because they tend to be very honest about their experiences in the community. This insight was invaluable in helping me understand my potential role and contributions should I join the institution. Fortunately, I didn't encounter this, but I believe a lack of adequate time for restroom breaks and proper meals during a visit is a huge red flag, indicating how the institution might treat its faculty. If you heard that this is normal, I'm telling you: it's not.  
  
 
### December 2023: Final offers and negotiating
<b>  ðŸ‘‰ Action items: <br>
    1. Once you get final offers, get advice from mentors on negotiating <br>
    2. If it's a public instituton, google  <br>
</b>  
<br>

As 

One thing to note is that the institutions I interviewed with moved quickly, leading me to decline interviews from other institutions once I began receiving final offers. It's normal in our field for on-campus visits to take place between January and March, towards the academic year's end.
