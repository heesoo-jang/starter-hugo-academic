Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Hussman School of Journalism and Media](http://hussman.unc.edu/), Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My advisor is [Dr. Shannon McGregor](http://www.shannoncmcgregor.com/). I'm also currently affiliated with the [Center for Information Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)](https://citap.unc.edu/). 

My research addresses the multifaceted impacts of AI systems on people and society. I use a diverse set of methodologies ---including both qualitative and quantitative methods--- to study the societal impacts of AI.

### üëâ News
- May 2021 (expected) - I'll be presenting a full paper titled "A co-oriented crisis communication model for an AI scansis: A Case of Chatbot, Lee-Luda" with my co-author [Dr. Suman Lee](http://hussman.unc.edu/news/research-conversations-associate-professor-suman-lee) at [ICA 2022](https://www.icahdq.org/page/ICA2022), [PR division](https://twitter.com/ica_prd). Fingers-crossed for seeing y'all in Paris! üóºü•êüá´üá∑ü•ñüåÜ‚ù§Ô∏è

Why did AI company ScatterLab fail in their crisis communication regarding their AI chatbot incident? We propose a co-oriented crisis communication model to analyze the case, and our study shows that the organization‚Äôs inaccurate understanding of the public‚Äôs perception of the crisis led to moral outrage, scandalizing the crisis into a scansis.

Can't wait to talk more about our theoretical model and case study at ICA!
