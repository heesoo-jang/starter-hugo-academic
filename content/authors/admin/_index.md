Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Hussman School of Journalism and Media](http://hussman.unc.edu/), Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My advisor is [Dr. Shannon McGregor](http://www.shannoncmcgregor.com/). I'm a [Royster fellow](https://gradschool.unc.edu/funding/gradschool/royster/) and a [Richard Cole fellow](https://web.archive.org/web/20191118042438/http://hussman.unc.edu/phd/cost-and-funding), and I'm also currently affiliated with the [Center for Information Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)](https://citap.unc.edu/). Previously, I worked at [SNU FactCheck Center](https://factcheck.snu.ac.kr/home/about), the first and only fact-checking platform in South Korea.

Through my research, I aim to address the multifaceted impacts of AI systems and digital platforms on people and society. More specifically, I study the discourses, framing efforts, and ethical issues around AI technology and digital platforms. I am passionate about my research because of its implications for democracy.

I approach my research with a ["social science salsa-dancing,"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674048218) perspective, using a diverse set of computational, quantitative, and qualitative methods.
