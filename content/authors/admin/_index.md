Hi! I'm a [Royster fellow](https://gradschool.unc.edu/funding/gradschool/royster/) and a [Richard Cole fellow](https://web.archive.org/web/20191118042438/http://hussman.unc.edu/phd/cost-and-funding) at the [Hussman School of Journalism and Media](http://hussman.unc.edu/), Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My advisor is [Dr. Shannon McGregor](http://www.shannoncmcgregor.com/). I'm also affiliated with the [Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)](https://citap.unc.edu/), where I am working as the policy graduate assistant for this academic year. Previously, I worked at [SNU FactCheck Center](https://factcheck.snu.ac.kr/home/about), the first and only fact-checking platform in South Korea.

### üëâ My Research
My research is at the intersection of journalism, media, and technology. My research aims to ensure that people have access to fair and democratic information systems. In this context, I study the <b>multifaceted impacts of emerging technologies and media, including AI systems and digital platforms,</b> on people, journalism, and society. I am passionate about my research because of its implications for justice and democracy. I'm a communication scholar by training, and I believe <b>how we communicate impacts and harms matters a lot</b>. Here are the projects I'm currently working on:
- Public discourses of ethical issues around AI systems (dissertation project)
- Public opinion of platform governance
- Reporting harms and biases of AI systems
- Digital harms of transnational platform ecosystems
- Impacts of emerging media and technologies on journalism 

I approach my research with a ["social science salsa-dancing,"](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674048218) perspective, using a diverse set of computational, quantitative, and qualitative methods.
