I'm an [Assistant Professor of Media Law and Ethics](https://www.umass.edu/journalism/news/journalism-announces-hiring-heesoo-jang) in [the department of Journalism, University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/journalism/). 

I'm a faculty affiliate with the [Global Technology for Social Justice Lab (GloTech)](https://glotechlab.net/) and the [Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)](https://citap.unc.edu/). I co-organize the Tech Policy Junior Scholar Working Group in collaboration with [Data & Society's Public Technology Leadership Collaborative (PTLC)](https://datasociety.net/public-technology-leadership-collaborative/), a peer-learning network of scholars, researchers, and government leaders focused on the social and cultural impacts of data and technology.

### ðŸ‘‰ Curious about my research?

My research examines AI ethics and platform governance through the lens of public accountability, equity, and systemic impact. As AI and digital platforms transform how information is produced and disseminated, I investigate their implications for democratic governance, social equity, and institutional transparency. I am particularly focused on the impact of these technologies on journalism, public relations, and legal systemsâ€”critical pillars of a healthy democracy that hold power to account, amplify marginalized voices, and foster informed public debate.

In my scholarship, I focus on addressing the disproportionate harms these technologies impose on historically marginalized communities, including but not limited to women, children, people of color, and populations in the [Majority World](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3584931.3608439). Recognizing that inequities manifest differently across social, economic, and geopolitical contexts, my work seeks to inform policies and governance frameworks that advance justice, inclusivity, and democratic resilience in the digital age.


### ðŸ‘‰ Going beyond academic walls

I am a public-facing scholar dedicated to making complex issues accessible and driving meaningful, real-world conversations.
