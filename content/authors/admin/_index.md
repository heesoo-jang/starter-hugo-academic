Hi! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the [Hussman School of Journalism and Media](http://hussman.unc.edu/), Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My advisor is [Dr. Shannon McGregor](http://www.shannoncmcgregor.com/). I'm also a graduate affiliate with the [Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP)](https://citap.unc.edu/). Previously, I worked at [SNU FactCheck Center](https://factcheck.snu.ac.kr/home/about), the first and only fact-checking platform in South Korea.

I am a multidisciplinary scholar who studies artificial intelligence ethics and digital platform governance in the context of healthy information systems. I am passionate about my research because of its implications for equity and democracy.
