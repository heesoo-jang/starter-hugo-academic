location: The 26th ACM Conference On Computer-Supported Cooperative Work And Social Computing


summary: This panel calls for a global conversation around platform (in)justice. By focusing on the experiences of marginalized communities, particularly those in the Majority World (also known as Global South), we aim to redefine justice and injustice through a global lens as opposed to a Western-centric lens. 
abstract: This panel calls for a global conversation around platform (in)justice. By focusing on the experiences of marginalized communities, particularly those in the Majority World (also known as Global South), we aim to redefine justice and injustice through a global lens as opposed to a Western-centric lens. Our panel will delve into the socio-technical realities of platforms as experienced by users and those doing the AI labor behind the platforms, recognizing platformsâ€™ tangible impacts on individuals and society. We invite the CSCW community to engage with five cases (involving Afghanistan, India, Korea, South Africa, and broader Latin America) that highlight the complex cultural, socio-economic, and political impact of technological systems on different social groups. With the Majority World as a framework of study, we explore locational forms of justice, and most importantly, open a discussion on structural solutions for platform injustice from the Majority World. Through our panel conversations, we aspire to shape a global research agenda for platform (in)justice, a focus area that can bring together expertise that is currently scattered across the CSCW community.
