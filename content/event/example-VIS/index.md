abstract: The talk provided insights into the immense potential of generative AI technologies within the newsroom, all while underscoring the critical importance of AI ethics. It not only introduced the concept of using established frameworks like the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) Code of Ethics, the principles of Data Feminism, and internal auditing frameworks to navigate these ethical concerns but also delved into the various types of AI harms and biases that need to be carefully considered. By addressing these issues, the presentation offered a comprehensive approach to ensuring that the integration of generative AI in journalism upholds the highest standards of ethics, transparency, and fairness, ultimately safeguarding the integrity of news reporting.
