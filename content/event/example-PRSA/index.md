summary: Unlocking the Power of Ethical Data Management in PR - Navigating Generative AI for Impactful, Responsible, and Inclusive Communication!
abstract: This talk explores three critical aspects of ethical data management in the realm of public relations (PR), with a special focus on the role of generative AI. Firstly, it highlights the imperative of responsible data collection, metric selection, and goal-setting, particularly in the context of generative AI, to prevent the unintentional generation of harmful or misleading content. Secondly, it underscores the importance of transparency in data presentation, acknowledging that even generative AI outputs are not entirely neutral, and calls for ethical framing and origin disclosure. Lastly, the talk advocates for leveraging generative AI-powered data to promote inclusivity and representativeness in PR discourse, considering the potential biases in AI algorithms and striving for more diverse and balanced perspectives. These principles collectively form a framework for responsible data management in PR, aligning it with ethical standards and harnessing the capabilities of generative AI to enhance its impact on organizational success and public discourse.
