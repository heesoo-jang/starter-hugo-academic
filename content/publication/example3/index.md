abstract: This study examined the ways in which intimacy is used in Asian entertainment media to build relationships between celebrities and audiences. The countries of interest were India and Korea, as the entertainment industries of both countries have increasingly challenged the global dominance of Hollywood. Using qualitative textual analysis, a total of four television shows (including talk shows and reality shows) from India and Korea were analyzed. Both shows used celebrities’ personal lives and connections to create intimacy with the public and amplify visibility.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
