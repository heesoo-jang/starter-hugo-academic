abstract: This study attempted to understand the different motivations, privacy concern levels, and privacy behaviors among different types of users and non-users of Tik Tok. Including active users, silent users, former users, and non-users, data were collected through an online survey of 266 respondents. The results revealed significant differences in motivations for using Tik Tok between active and silent users. Discrepancies existed between Tik Tok non-users’ perceptions of the users’ motivations and the actual motivations of users. Non-users of Tik Tok were more concerned about both online privacy in general and the privacy risks of Tik Tok compared to active users of Tik Tok. Results also showed that silent users are closer to former users in terms of their motivations for using Tik Tok, but their privacy risk perceptions of Tik Tok are closer to those of active users. This study is the first to examine differences in motivations, privacy concern levels, and privacy behaviors among different types of users and non-users of Tik Tok.
