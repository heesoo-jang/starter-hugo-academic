abstract: This study investigated the role of journalism in safeguarding democracy. To accomplish this, it introduces a novel framework termed "democracy-framed journalism," which emphasizes the foregrounding of democracy both as an established norm and as a political ideal. Using the U.S. as a case study, the study applies the framework to analyze a comprehensive dataset of 708 articles encompassing 21 races in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Additionally, interviews with twelve journalists are conducted to evaluate their perspectives and practices regarding democracy-framed coverage. While the study centers on the U.S. as a case study, its implications extend beyond this specific context, offering insights into the broader challenges faced by democratic societies worldwide. The findings reveal a significant gap in journalism's performance, with limited presence of democracy-frames and weak statements in addressing election deniers. The study underscores the urgency of addressing threats to democracy and proposes a normative and analytical framework for evaluating journalistic contributions to safeguarding democratic processes.
