abstract: If you think the notion of news manipulation and censorship is relegated to the dark annals of authoritarian regimes, it’s time to reconsider. A closer look at the unfolding narrative in South Korea paints a disconcertingly different picture. The actions of the current administration of President Yoon Suk-yeol have cast a long shadow over press freedom in South Korea. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
